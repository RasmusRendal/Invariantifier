# Introduction
This repository contains code for the DAT50E20 group project at AAU on invariance in machine learning.

# Setup
To run the main program, make sure that you have installed the correct dependencies through pip using `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` or through a package manager.

# Running the Code
To run the primary code, run the command `python3 main.py`.
Additionally, `serial_main.py` can be run for easy access to profiler information and to generate data on how the program runs.
If desired, the options for running the program can be found in `src/options.py`, or by passing the `-h` argument.

# Testing
To run the test-suite, execute the bash script in the `tests/` folder
